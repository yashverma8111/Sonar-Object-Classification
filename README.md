# Sonar-Object-Classification
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar data. The project employs a Logistic Regression model to make accurate predictions.

# Project Overview
In this project, we aim to classify underwater objects using sonar data. Sonar is a technique that uses sound propagation to navigate, communicate, and detect objects underwater. The dataset used for this project contains features extracted from sonar signals, and the goal is to train a model that can effectively differentiate between rocks and mines.

# Project Structure
The repository includes the following key components:

sonar_data.csv: This CSV file contains the dataset used for training and testing the model. It includes various features extracted from sonar signals, and the corresponding labels indicating whether an object is a rock ('R') or a mine ('M').

main.py: This Python script contains the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing it, training a Logistic Regression model, and making predictions. It also includes an example prediction for custom input data.

README.md: This README file provides an overview of the project, its goals, and instructions for running the code. It also explains the dataset, the model used, and how to interpret the predictions.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn).
Run main.py using a Python interpreter. This script will load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and showcase an example prediction.
Example Prediction
The script main.py includes an example prediction using custom input data. The input data represents feature values extracted from a sonar signal. Based on the trained model, the script will predict whether the input data corresponds to a rock or a mine.

# Note
This project serves as a simple demonstration of using machine learning for sonar object classification. You can further enhance the project by experimenting with different algorithms, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.

Feel free to explore the code, run the example, and contribute to the project by improving the model's accuracy or adding more features.
